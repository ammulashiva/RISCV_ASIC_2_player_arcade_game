### RISCV GNU tool chain

RISCV GNU tool chain is a C & C++ cross compiler. It has two modes: ELF/Newlib toolchain and Linux-ELF/glibc toolchain. We are using ELF/Newlib toolchain.

We are building a custom RISCV based application core for a specific application for 32 bit processor. 

Following are tools required to compile & execute the application:

1. RISCV GNU toolchain with dependent libraries as specified in [RISCV-GNU-Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain).

2. Spike simulator - Spike is a functional RISC-V ISA simulator that implements a functional model of one or more RISC-V harts. [RISCV-SPIKE](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim.git).

### RISCV 32 bit compiler installation.

```
sudo apt install libc6-dev
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain --recursive
mkdir riscv32-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=/home/ammula-shiva-kumar/riscv32-toolchain/ --with-arch=rv32i --with-abi=ilp32
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
make
```

Access the riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc inside bin folder of riscv32-toolchain folder in home folder of user as shown.

```
